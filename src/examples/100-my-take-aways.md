# Conclusion

# Typescript's Purpose

- Typescript helps to point out unhandled situations
- Transparency with props and responses
- Helps to show intent making code easier to read and follow
- Forces you to develop more carefully and intentionally
- Good types reduce the need for unit tests
- After types are in place CI/type-checking will inforce that those types continue to be used correctly

## The Conversion Process

- Typescript is frustrating until you get a full section to 100%
- I hated Typescript until I got my personal project to 100%, then I began to like it
- Typescript feels like another layer of security and validation
